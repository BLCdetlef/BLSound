<h2 id="infoTitle">Blue and Green Water</h2>

<p>Blue water refers to rivers, lakes, and groundwater – in other words, directly usable freshwater – while green water is stored in the soil and absorbed by plants through their roots. Since the seventeenth century, when blue water use was still at the planetary boundary of ten percent, usage has steadily increased. By around the year 2005, a significantly higher level of use was already evident, driven by population growth, industrialization, and intensive agriculture. Our forecast shows that by the year 2050, around one-third of available freshwater will be used. Climate change, altered precipitation patterns, and declining groundwater levels further reinforce this trend. In Germany, the effects are already noticeable – some municipalities have had to declare drinking water emergencies during dry summers.</p>
