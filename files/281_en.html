<h2 id="infoTitle">The Alps in Climate Change – Consequences, Challenges, and Outlook</h2>

<p>The Alps are among the regions in Europe most affected by climate change. This is especially visible in the rapid melting of Alpine glaciers, which are vital as water reservoirs, for ecosystems, and for tourism. According to GLAMOS and the Alpine Climate Observatory, around sixty percent of glacier volume has disappeared since 1850 – with about one third lost between 2000 and 2020 alone. Extreme years like 2022 and 2023 saw record levels of melting. The primary cause is human-induced climate change – the Alps are warming at twice the global average rate. The albedo effect, lack of snow, and extreme weather events further accelerate the melt. The Alpine Club warns of ecological consequences, water shortages, flooding, and risks to infrastructure. Tourism, agriculture, and energy are also affected. According to *Nature* (2025), the Alps could be nearly ice-free by 2100 – even if the Paris Agreement is upheld. Adaptation measures and emissions reductions are urgently needed.</p>
