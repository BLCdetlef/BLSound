<h2 id="infoTitle">Forest Area</h2>

<p>The diagram shows how the global forest area has changed from 1700 to 2100, or is expected to change. It clearly illustrates that the forest area has significantly decreased since 1700. 
    The greatest losses occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, as more land was needed for agriculture, fuelwood, and industrial expansion. In the 1980s, deforestation peaked with around 150 million hectares lost. 
    Although the rate of loss slowed afterwards, many millions of hectares were still lost each year in the 1990s and 2000s. Today, the forest area is only about 60% of its original size. 
    This means we have already fallen below the so-called planetary boundary of 75%. However, for the future, it is assumed that the situation could improve somewhat if more reforestation takes place. 
    Forecasts suggest that by 2050 we could reach about 65%, and by 2100 about 68%. 
    Overall, the diagram shows that global forests have shrunk significantly, but reforestation offers a chance to somewhat improve the trend in the future.</p>
